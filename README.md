# Secure Framework for Cloud-Based Remote Patient Monitoring

## Overview

This project, titled "Y Secure Framework for Cloud-Based Remote Patient Monitoring and In-Place Sensor-Based Care," is spearheaded by Professor Prasad Calyam of the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at the University of Missouri, with industry mentorship from Ms. Deborah Kessler. It aims to address the escalating issue of heart failure, a leading cause of hospitalization among those over 65, by developing a secure, cloud-based system for remote patient monitoring focusing on peripheral edema as a key indicator.

## Project Executive Summary

Heart failure affects millions, with hospitalizations not only increasing mortality but also reducing quality of life. Traditional monitoring methods are manual and subjective. Our project proposes a novel, secure, and comprehensive cloud-based system to remotely monitor patients, specifically tracking ankle circumference as a reliable measure of peripheral edema, thereby facilitating early intervention and potentially reducing hospitalizations.

## Project Goals

- **Year 1**: Develop a secure cloud-based system for remote monitoring, focusing on the integration of an anklet device for continuous ankle circumference monitoring, alongside developing a web portal for clinician and caregiver access.
- **Year 2**: Extend the system to incorporate external healthcare data sources and implement machine learning-based analytics for personalized treatment recommendations, aiming for a closed-loop system in chronic disease management.

## Use Cases

1. **End-to-End Demo System**: To research end-user requirements and facilitate the co-creation of mainstream market products.
2. **Clinical Studies Support**: Providing evidence required by investors and for customer commitment.

## Project Activities and Timeline

- **Months 1-3**: Design and implement the cloud-based monitoring framework.
- **Months 4-6**: Integrate and secure the data collection pipeline.
- **Months 7-12**: Develop data analytics processes and a web portal for data access.
- **Months 13-24**: Extend the system to include a common data model (CDM) and machine learning-based analytics for personalized patient care.

## Anticipated Challenges and Mitigation Strategies

Challenges include prioritizing tasks within a limited budget and ensuring secure integration of medical devices. Strategies involve close coordination with stakeholders and dedicating resources to critical development areas.

## Expected Results

- A secure, cloud-based framework for remote patient monitoring.
- A prototype system for continuous monitoring of ankle circumference, accessible by patients, caregivers, and clinicians.
- Integration of healthcare data for personalized treatment plans.
